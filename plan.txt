# Hook this up in your urls.py -- the URL is going to be the thing the Javascript calls.
def get_access_token(request):
	access_token = request.POST['access_token']
	user_id = request.POST['user_id']

	assert access_token

	assert len(access_token) < 4000

	(Here you probably want to try exchanging it.)

	response = requests.get('/oauth/access_token', params={
		'grant_type'='fb_exchange_token',        
	    'client_id'={app-id}
	    'client_secret'={app-secret},
	    'fb_exchange_token'={short-lived-token},
	})

	deal with response.json() ?

	this includes the expiry date/time, store that in particp table (it better)

	get the user ID / name from here!

	send to database right there

	return HttpResponse("Yaay", content_type="text/plain")



def home(request):
	# render the template that has the JS sdk.
